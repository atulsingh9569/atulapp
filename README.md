# Technical Assessment Project: Voice Command Shopping Assistant

## Overview
This project is a voice-based shopping list manager with smart suggestions, built for the Software Engineering position technical assessment. It is a modern web app using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase Hosting. Voice recognition is handled via the browser's SpeechRecognition API (with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text integration possible).

## Features
### 1. Voice Input
- **Voice Command Recognition:** Add items using voice ("Add milk", "I need apples").
- **NLP:** Flexible phrase handling ("I want to buy bananas", "Add bananas to my list").
- **Multilingual Support:** Easily extendable for multiple languages (currently English).

### 2. Smart Suggestions
- **Product Recommendations:** Suggests items based on history and preferences.
- **Seasonal Recommendations:** Suggests in-season items.
- **Substitutes:** Offers alternatives if a product is unavailable.

### 3. Shopping List Management
- **Add/Remove/Modify Items:** By voice or text ("Remove milk from my list").
- **Categorize Items:** Auto-categorizes (dairy, produce, snacks, etc.).
- **Quantity Management:** Specify quantities by voice ("Add 2 bottles of water").

### 4. Voice-Activated Search
- **Item Search:** Search for items by voice, including brand, size, or price ("Find me organic apples").
- **Price Range Filtering:** Voice-based filter ("Find toothpaste under $5").

### 5. UI/UX
- **Minimalist Interface:** Simple, clean shopping list display.
- **Visual Feedback:** Real-time display of recognized items and actions.
- **Mobile/Voice-Only Optimized:** Responsive and touch-friendly.

### 6. Hosting
- **Firebase Hosting:** Reliable, fast deployment.

## Technical Approach (200 words max)
The app uses React for UI, Vite for fast development, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Voice commands are processed using the browserâ€™s SpeechRecognition API, with NLP logic to parse varied phrases and extract item names, quantities, and actions (add/remove/search). Smart suggestions are generated based on season and simulated shopping history, with easy extension for real user data. Items are auto-categorized and can be managed by voice or text. The UI is minimalist, with real-time feedback and mobile optimization. For deployment, Firebase Hosting is used for reliability and speed. The code is modular, clean, and includes error handling and loading states for a smooth user experience. Multilingual support and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text integration can be added as needed.
